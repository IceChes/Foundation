# Foundation
Foundation is a high-end Cartesian bedslinger designed to be very easy to print and build, be simple to modify, and have high throughput.

Foundation has a number of interesting features making it appealing to new and experienced builders including:
1. Dual motor Y axis for extremely rapid acceleration no matter the size of the print on the plate.
2. EVA-based toolhead design for modularity and ease of construction.
3. Extrusion based frame does not require any drilling, only T nuts and a few tapped holes.
4. All ABS parts are designed for maximum ease of printing.
5. Underslung electronics enclosure makes quick wiring changes simple.
6. Highly stiff construction.
7. Support for groundbreaking wire cable Z braces.
8. Self replicating.

# Supported Mods
Because Foundation is intended to be modified, I am officially supporting some user mods. What you get if you submit a mod and have it accepted:
1. Official documentation in the wiki.
2. Credits here.
3. Your files in this repo.

To submit a supported mod, fork this repo, make a new directory in the "Supported Mods" directory, and add your files there. If you feel like adding documentation yourself, include a markdown file for me to merge into the wiki. Otherwise, I will write the documentation. When you are done making your mod, submit a PR to this repo. I will review it and I *may or may not* add it. A supported mod must meet the following requirements:
1. Fits Foundation's utilitarian aesthetic.
2. Relatively easy to source/print parts.
3. No logos! I'll credit you below.
