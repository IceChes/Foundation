# Foundation

Foundation is a high-end Cartesian bedslinger designed for versatility, modularity, and speed. It can cost anywhere from $350 to over $450 depending on which configuration you use. It has a small 150mm^3 build area, which should hold most prints. If it doesn't, the machine is entirely scalable.

Current Version: Release 1.0

Foundation is a WIP machine and the first prototype is not fully built yet. I do not recommend building anything until the first prototype is working.

# Feature List
- Dual Y motors for high acceleration even when printing large objects.
- Extremely rigid construction.
- Extrusion and T nut based construction for easy construction and modification. You can use slide nuts too!
- Uses a modified version of the highly versatile EVA toolhead.
- Innovative electronics mounting.
- Supports high performance Voron Switchwire vibration isolating feet.
- Supports any Volcano compatible hotend.
- Can self-replicate.
- Rigid aluminum bed weighs only about 400g including the heater and build surface.
- Completely scalable. Just increase the size of the bed and bed mount DXF and buy appropriately larger frame pieces.
- ABS parts are very easily printable. 

# Supported Mods and Alternative Configurations
A supported modification is a user (or creator) made modification that I have decided to provide support for. Want to make one? It must follow these requirements:
- Must be somewhat easy to build or configure.
- Fits the utilitarian style and aesthetic of the Foundation.
- No logos or anything! I'll credit you below.

What you get if I decide to support a mod:
- Documentation provided by me.
- Addition of any and all files to this GitHub repo.
- Your name credited here.

If you have made a modification and you want it supported, open a PR. PRs must be identical to the original repo, but have your files included in a new folder.

# Updates
Will come depending solely on if I feel like updating the design. At some point this printer will be completely converted to coreXZ. 

# Versioning 
The Foundation uses a special incrementing version system. Increments in the number after the period means that one or more parts need to be reprinted to upgrade, and/or 2 purchased components or less need to be swapped out or added. Increments in the first number mean that more than 2 purchased components need to be swapped out or added.
