# Foundation

Foundation is a high-end Cartesian bedslinger designed for versatility, modifiability, and speed. It can cost anywhere from $350 to over $450 depending on which configuration you use. 

Current Version: Release 1.0

Foundation is a WIP machine and the first prototype does not work yet. I do not recommend building anything until the first prototype is working.

# Updates
Will come depending solely on if I feel like updating the design.

# Versioning 
The Foundation uses a special incrementing version system. Increments in the number after the period means that one or more parts need to be reprinted to upgrade, and/or 2 purchased components or less need to be swapped out or added. Increments in the first number mean that more than 2 purchased components need to be swapped out or added.
