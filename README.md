# Foundation
Foundation. It means "an underlying basis or principle". And that's exactly what this machine is. While it'll probably work just fine when you put it together, it's not designed to be operated that way. Instead, it's been designed so that you can take it and do what you like with it.

V 1.0.0

WARNING! UNTESTED!

- Must be somewhat easy to build or configure.
- Fits the utilitarian style and aesthetic of the Foundation.
