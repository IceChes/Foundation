# Foundation

Foundation is a high-end Cartesian bedslinger designed for versatility, modularity, and speed. It can cost anywhere from $350 to over $450 depending on which configuration you use. 

Current Version: Release 1.0

Foundation is a WIP machine and the first prototype does not work yet. I do not recommend building anything until the first prototype is working.

- Must be somewhat easy to build or configure.
- Fits the utilitarian style and aesthetic of the Foundation.
- No logos or anything! I'll credit you below.

What you get if I decide to support a mod:

# Updates
Will come depending solely on if I feel like updating the design. At some point this printer will be completely converted to coreXZ.

# Versioning 
The Foundation uses a special incrementing version system. Increments in the number after the period means that one or more parts need to be reprinted to upgrade, and/or 2 purchased components or less need to be swapped out or added. Increments in the first number mean that more than 2 purchased components need to be swapped out or added. 

# 1.0 Changelog
