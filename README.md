# Foundation
Foundation is a mid-tier Cartesian bedslinger designed to be very easy to print and build, be simple to modify, and have high throughput. This printer exists to prove that bedslingers can be a viable alternative to other types of motion systems under certain circumstances.

Foundation is NOT supported anymore. 

Current version: 1.1 "green".

Foundation has a number of interesting features making it appealing to new and experienced builders including:
1. Dual motor Y axis for extremely rapid acceleration no matter the size of the print on the plate.
2. EVA-based toolhead design for modularity and ease of construction.
3. Extrusion based frame does not require any drilling, only T nuts and a few tapped holes.
4. All ABS parts are designed for maximum ease of printing.
5. Underslung electronics enclosure makes quick wiring changes simple.
6. Highly stiff construction.
7. Support for groundbreaking wire cable Z braces.
8. Self replicating.

# Issues
1. Imparallel belt paths on the X and Y axis cause binding at high speeds.
2. Custom aluminum parts are only available in the USA or from expensive companies internationally.
3. The dual motor Y axis does not work correctly with one motor driver and should only be used with 2 drivers.
